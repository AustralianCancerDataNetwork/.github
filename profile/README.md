# ACDN

Our projects span data models, imaging pipelines, synthetic data generation, and clinical NLP, with a strong emphasis on reproducibility, interoperability, and governance-aware design. Wherever possible, analysis is performed where data resides, enabling collaboration across institutions and jurisdictions without centralising sensitive data.

### What lives here? 

You will find a collection of interoperable tools, reference implementations, and exploratory projects that support oncology research infrastructure, including:

* Imaging and radiotherapy pipelines for converting, analysing, and validating clinical data
* Synthetic data generation to enable development, testing, and training without exposing patient data
* Clinical NLP resources focused on practical extraction targets and reusable workflows
* Stand-alone research projects that document end-to-end analytic processes
